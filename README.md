Instructions for the Project:

    1.  The final game code is in main.py file.
    2.  To run the code, you will need to install the required packages using the following commands:
                pip install tkinter 
                pip install pygame
    3.  The code in game_logic.py, UI.py, file_manager.py files wasnâ€™t made to be run by itself (these were raw codes created individually by different team members).
    4.  Ensure that all the images used in the game are placed in the same folder as main.py.
    5.  The game requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system.
    6.  Make sure to keep the record.csv file in the same directory as main.py for the score tracking feature to work.
    7.  If the images are not loading properly, ensure that the file paths in the code correctly reference the images in the project folder.
